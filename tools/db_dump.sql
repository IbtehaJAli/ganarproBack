Mercy Iowa City Rehabilitation Hospital, located at 2801 Heartland Drive in Coralville, is expected to open by the second quarter of 2020 and will provide care for patients recovering from stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, amputation and other conditions.\r\n\r\n“We are excited to work with Kindred Healthcare on this joint venture to enhance the rehabilitation services offered to patients in the community,” said Sean Williams, President and CEO of Mercy Iowa City. “The facility will serve the growing population of patients in need of comprehensive rehabilitation care by giving them access to state-of-the-art technology and treatment options to advance the recovery process.”\r\n\r\nThe 54,000-square-foot facility will feature 40 patient beds, along with gymnasiums outfitted for high-tech therapy devices and treatments, a dedicated traumatic brain injury unit complete with monitored rooms, specialized beds and patient lifting equipment, and separate therapy and dining spaces. The hospital will also have a unit exclusively for stroke patients, rooms specially equipped for bariatric patients, and private, family-friendly rooms with sleeper chairs. Patients will have access to an apartment setting where they can practice daily living tasks before they return home, and pet therapy and community re-entry programs will help ease the transition back to home.

The building, which is currently the visitor parking lot of Motorists Insurance Group, is on Oak Street behind the Motorists Building and faces the Topiary Park.\r\n\r\nThe first phase of a Downtown redevelopment project pushed by Motorists Insurance Group near the Topiary Park has been given the green light.\r\n\r\nThe Downtown Commission approved the first building for the planned five-story apartment complex to be built on what is now a set of parking lots near the insurer's tower on E. Broad Street. This first phase will have 91 units of what have been described as London- or New York-style brownstones on the northern border of the park.\r\n\r\nThe apartments will be served by a 155-space parking garage.\r\n\r\nRobert Weiler Co. is the developer for the site, Moody Nolan Inc. is architect and Edge is its landscape architect.\r\n\r\nMike Lisi of Motorist Insurance Group, which owns the land, told the Downtown Commission in June that the development was taking context from the neighborhood, with Victorian and Italianate style residences with red brick, stone lintels, bay windows and varied roof lines.\r\n\r\nThe project is a long-term development, with future phases taking some time to develop based on how the economy grows in coming years, Lisi said.\r\n\r\nA  commercial space was proposed for the east side of the development.\r\n\r\nTim Skinner, a partner with Edge, said there will be some grading to ensure those partially underground units don't flood.

The two-building complex will hold 49 total apartments, five of them affordable, and nearly 11,000 square feet of ground floor retail, all a half-mile from the Expo Line’s 26th Street/Bergamot station.\r\n\r\nWithin the next two months, LaTerra plans to break ground on a separate project nearby. Located at Santa Monica and Yale, the development will hold 46 market-rate and four affordable apartments, plus 10,000 square feet of retail space—about three-quarters of a mile from the 26th Street station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth apartment projects will have rooftop decks and amenities including gyms, pet-focused amenities, and outdoor lounge areas. They’ll each offer a mix of studios, one-, two-, and three-bedroom units, a choice that was “crafted carefully to appeal to Santa Monica’s wide resident demographic ranging from Silicon Beach professionals to entertainment industry creatives to hip entrepreneurs,” La Terra says in an announcement for the project.

92	0064400000tH8lNAAS	Penn Sub-2/WARB	None	new york	NY	None	HUNTER ROBERTS CONSTRUCTION GROUP	Adding access points to more tracks would allow passengers to clear the platforms faster. Moynihan Station’s Phase 1 just extended one passageway as far as it could go, covering Amtrak and some NJT tracks. Nichols proposed extending another LIRR passageway to make egress from Amtrak and NJT easier; however, this extension did not become part of the plan. The more functional Phase 1 has just finished at a cost of $315 million, a fraction of Phase 2’s estimated cost of $1.6 billion. (Phase 2 is expected to open in 2020.)\r\n\r\nAcross the street from Penn Station, the $1.6 billion conversion of the James A. Farley Post Office Building into Moynihan Train Hall also began in 2017. When complete, the 255,000-square-foot hall will have nine train platforms, 17 tracks and a skylight — plus 700,000 square feet of retail and other commercial space — and will provide an underground connection to Penn Station. The new train hall will also serve as Amtrak's headquarters in New York City and as a hub for the LIRR. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.constructiondive.com/news/construction-begins-on-new-600m-main-entrance-at-nycs-penn-station/557072/	None	None	2019-03-13 05:42:03+00	2019-11-14 23:00:44+00	None	None	None	0	Broke Ground	None	2020-06-30	2019-03-13	None	HUNTER ROBERTS CONSTRUCTION GROUP	1717 ARCH ST FL 34 Philadelpha PA 19103	(215) 832-4300	http://partner.hrcg.com/sites/registration/SitePages/PartnerRegistration.aspx	http://www.linkedin.com/company/hunter-roberts-construction-group	https://www.facebook.com/hunterrobertscg?directed_target_id=0	https://twitter.com/hunterrobertscg	For issues pertaining to the Penn Sub-2/WARB project, please contact Mike Tillou, or George Bergey- Field Superintendent at 215-253-****.\r\n\r\nKevin Burns |	March 05 2019	We are at least 18 months away from final clean.

The future shelter will include 3,500 square-feet of modern animal habitats, isolation and intake areas, custom “catios” and kennels, multiple yards and a large community room.\r\n\r\n“The new place will be about six times the size of our current shelter,” said executive director Alison “Ali” Talley. “One of the things I’m most excited about is that in the coming years we’re going to be able to double the number of animal lives saved.”\r\n\r\nSanta Cruz SPCA has been a part of the community for more than 80 years. Each year, it saves more than 500 animals through programs that rehabilitate and re-home animals.\r\n\r\n“We’re expecting to open in the spring of 2020,” Talley said. “Construction began in March and it’s changing by the day. Right now everything is going according to plan. We’re really happy with the progress as it stays on track.”	None	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tIYkAQ9hMEbk_61BGETgm1v8XcE1I63q/view?usp=sharing	2019-06-27 08:02:59+00	2019-12-27 12:35:25+00	None	None	None	7106	Broke Ground	None	2020-01-06	2019-06-27	None	Bogard Construction	350-A Coral Street Santa Cruz CA 95060-2107	(831) 426-8191	None	None	https://www.facebook.com/Bogard-Construction-Inc-113048595430448/	https://twitter.com/BogardConst	You will want to speak with our Site Superintendent Paul Ronzano (cc’d above) for final cleanup. but the Cleaning is several months out\r\n\r\nMichael Ball - Assistant Project Manager\r\ncc: Paul Ronzano	November 01 2019	We have already secured a concrete polishing number, but you are welcome to send a competing a bid as the change is not yet finalized.

167	0062R00000teUNtQAM	the (37) SW Arterial	None	Dubuque	IA	None	Portzen Construction	DUBUQUE, Iowa (KCRG) -- The work on building the Southwest Arterial project in Dubuque has reached a milestone despite rain this spring that's hindered construction projects across eastern Iowa.\r\n\r\nConstruction continues on the SW Arterial project in Dubuque despite rainy weather. (Charlie Grant, KCRG)\r\nThe arterial is a road that will connect Highway 20 to Highways 61 and 151. Funding for the $168 million project has come from both local and federal governments.\r\n\r\nThe bridge that goes over Highway 20 is nearing completion and should be done this month or in July. That alone costs $9.5 million.\r\n\r\nJust last week the Highway 20 westbound lane was opened to traffic, ending a two-year detour. Assistant city engineer Bob Schiesl says that's a big milestone for the entire project.\r\n\r\nSchiesl said the weather has impacted construction, but he's not sure yet if it will impact their long-term schedule.\r\n\r\n"If Mother Nature cooperates and they can get, you know the rest of the construction season with decent weather, hopefully, they can catch up but again it's too premature right now, but it has had an effect," he said.\r\n\r\nSo far crews have completed 14 phases of construction, and they're currently working on 12 more.

Additionally, new work spaces were created on the 2nd thru 5th floors.

269	0062R00000tIThUQAW	East Beach Lake Lodge and Banquet Facility	Lake Tholocco Recreation Area	Ft. Rucker	AL	None	LIFECYCLE CONSTRUCTION SERVICES INC	Fort Rucker hosted a groundbreaking ceremony for the East Beach Lake Lodge and Banquet Facility today at 9 a.m. at Lake Tholocco. \r\n\r\nOnce construction is finalized, the new addition on post will feature a two-story, 20-unit recreational lodge and a 156-guest banquet facility overlooking Lake Tholocco.\r\nThe project is expected to be completed by the Fall of 2019.\r\n\r\nA more than 10-year old vision became a reality Oct. 2 as the shovels of Fort Rucker, U.S. Army Aviation Center of Excellence and contractor construction officials broke ground on the East Beach Lake Lodge and Banquet Facility during a ceremony on the shore of Lake Tholocco.\r\n\r\nGetting to the point of breaking ground on the 20-room recreational lodge and 156-guest banquet facility is a story of that vision, and of perseverance, said William "Bill" G. Kidd, deputy to the commanding general of USAACE and Fort Rucker.\r\n\r\nWhile making the lodge a reality was a team effort from a host of people across Fort Rucker, that vision and perseverance belonged to a handful of people, Kidd said, recognizing Tim Laster, former Directorate of Family, and Morale, Welfare and Recreation; Evy Bludsworth, DFMWR chief of support services; and John Clancy, outdoor recreation manager.\r\n\r\n"(They) recognized the importance of providing opportunities and recreation for our Soldiers, because that is an integral part of readiness for our families, for our Soldiers and for our units," he said. "It was a vision they weren't going to give up on -- they were not going to give up on our Soldiers and they were going to keep pushing."\r\n\r\nHe said that his father, an engineer, said that there were three ways that you could traverse a mountain: you could go over it, you could move it, or you could just wear it out. "And, ladies and gentlemen, the Fort Rucker team and the Wiregrass community just wore it out on this one. \r\n\r\n"It's a great feeling and well worth the wait," Kidd continued. "It will be a wonderful addition. We're very excited about not just having the building, but what it will bring to our families and our Soldiers as they use this area at Lake Tholocco for recreation."\r\n\r\nThe facility is expected to be completed in about a year, said Wayne Bardell, director of Fort Rucker DFMWR, adding that he expects the lodge to attract Soldiers from throughout the Army to the shores of Lake Tholocco and all of the recreational opportunities it affords them: boat rentals, swimming beaches with water slides, fishing, hunting and more.\r\n\r\nBesides the numerous amenities associated with the lodging and banquet areas, the 16,880-square foot facility will also feature a boardwalk to a 650-square foot landing deck, a wedding gazebo with a wedding area and paver path to the lake and a 4,850-square foot deck overlooking the lake.\r\n\r\nhttps://lifecycleconstruction.sharefile.com/d-s07d42a5522c433ba  ß plans\r\nhttps://lifecycleconstruction.sharefile.com/d-s350e6387fe2446da  ß wage scale	None	None	2019-06-04 03:29:37+00	2019-09-19 08:49:24+00	None	None	None	22380	Broke Ground	None	2019-12-30	2019-06-03	None	LIFECYCLE CONSTRUCTION SERVICES INC	1200 G ST NW STE 800 WASHINGTON DC	(202) 661-6113	https://drive.google.com/a/final-clean.com/file/d/0B5m56nC_a6IjeWNGbEh4RkltZkk/view?usp=drivesdk	https://www.linkedin.com/company/lifecycle-construction-services	https://www.facebook.com/LifecycleConstruction/	None	The contact is valid I spoke with Mr. England and the project won't be complete until next year.\r\nprkr2601@aol.com	September 19 2019	Yes.

382	0062R00000teVbPQAU	Annacis Island Waste Water Treatment Plant	1299 Derwent Way	Delta	BC	None	Graham Construction	ANNACIS ISLAND WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT GETS UPGRADE\r\n\r\nThe Delta-based Annacis Island Wastewater Treatment Plant, which serves 1.25 million people, is undergoing major upgrades to meet Metro Vancouver's growing population.\r\n\r\nMetro Vancouver has awarded a $252-million contract to Graham/AECON for the first phase of the upgrade project, which includes additional primary sedimentation tanks, solids contact tanks, and secondary clarifiers as well as improved odour control systems at the plant. It also includes seismic improvements.\r\n\r\nThe first phase is expected to be completed in 2021, with the second phase to start the following year. The phased-in approach is partly aimed at maintaining uninterrupted operations of the existing facilities during construction, while accommodating other high priority repair and maintenance projects to keep the existing plant in good shape.\r\n\r\nThe upgrades are expected to boost the plant's treatment capacity to accommodate another 250,000 people, while continuing to protect public health and the environment.\r\n\r\nAs part of the upgrades, a new outfall pipe is required to convey treated wastewater to the Fraser River. The design and permitting process for this project is well underway, with construction set for 2019 to 2022. \r\n\r\nThe new outfall will involve a four-metre diameter tunnel, about a kilometer long and at a depth of 40 metres underground. This will be constructed from the plant to the river, where a diffuser system will be installed on the river bottom.  The outfall location and design will improve water quality downstream from the plant, be more earthquake resilient, and more adaptable to sea level rise associated with climate change.\r\n\r\nMetro Vancouver staff are working with First Nations, river users, local businesses and government agencies to identify potential project impacts and to find ways to minimize them.  Project information is available here: (http://www.metrovancouver.org/services/liquid-waste/consultations/annacis-island-wwtp/about-project/Pages/default.aspx), and meetings are planned with potentially impacted and interested groups to listen to concerns and to work together throughout the project.\r\n\r\nAnnacis Island Waste Water Treatment Plant\r\nLocation: Vancouver, BC\r\nDesigner: ABR Engineering\r\nAreas Completed: Below Slab\r\nApprox.

410	0062R00000tITouQAG	Wharf Phase 2	None	Washington	DC	None	Balfour Beatty Construction US	Hoffman-Madison Waterfront, developer of The Wharf, a $2.5 billion mixed-use development in Washington, D.C.’s Southwest Waterfront neighborhood, has selected Balfour Beatty as the first general contractor for the landside portion of the project’s Phase 2, according to a press release sent to Construction Dive.\r\nBalfour Beatty’s contract covers more than 1 million square feet of above- and below-grade construction on the development’s Parcels 6 and 7 and includes site work and site utilities; hardscape and parks; two parking garages totaling 660,000 square feet; a 290,000-square-foot office building; and a second office building totaling 237,000 square feet. Balfour Beatty will  procure subcontractors and start work immediately.\r\nBalfour Beatty already completed three Phase 1 Wharf projects — a condominium building, an office building and an modernization expansion of The Municipal Fish Market, the oldest operating open-air fish market in the U.S. Last year, Cianbro began construction of the marina in Phase 2, which should be complete in 2022.\r\n\r\nDive Insight:\r\nUltimately, Phase 2 of The Wharf will add approximately 1.2 million square feet of mixed-use developments to about a half-mile of the waterfront. In addition to the marina, parks, underground parking and Parcel 6 and Parcel 7 office space, Phase 2 will also include retail, restaurants, apartments and a hotel on Parcel 8, condominiums on Parcel 9 and more office space on Parcel 10.\r\n\r\nPhase 1 of The Wharf opened in late 2017 and includes more than 850 residential units, 225,000 square feet of office space, three hotels and 175,000 square feet of retail. The office component also features Pier 4, the first pier-top office building in D.C. The building has 28,000 square feet of space, extends 260 feet over the water and is next to a 3.5-acre park. \r\n\r\nThe Wharf development is just one contributor to the city's $50 billion development pipeline. The Washington, D.C. Economic Partnership said that at the end of 2018, under construction was 6.2 million square feet of office space, almost 2 million square feet of hospitality projects, 1.5 million square feet of retail and a whopping 14 million square feet of residential. Planned projects that were not yet under construction as of year's end total 124 million square feet and are worth approximately $38 billion.\r\n\r\nClark Construction leads all other contractors as far as the number of D.C. projects (56), followed by Hamel Builders, Whiting-Turner, Grunley Construction and Turner Construction.

431	0064400000qShBhAAK	Aloft Hotel in Wilmington	None	Wilmington	NC	None	Clancy & Theys Construction Company	lancy & Theys has been chosen as the general contractor for the new Aloft Hotel planned in downtown Wilmington. The 125‐room hotel will be adjacent to the Coastline Conference & Event Center, which Clancy & Theys will be renovating as part of the project.\r\n\r\n“It’s a blending of the old and the new,” said David F. Michael, vice president and CEO of the Clancy & Theys Wilmington division, noting that the project will maintain the historic structure of the conference and event center, while incorporating modern features in the hotel.\r\n\r\nThe seven‐story hotel will feature a rooftop bar lined with LED lights. The custom lighting will make it visible from the Cape Fear Memorial Bridge at night, cementing the new hotel as a signature landmark of the historic riverfront. Guests will be able to host weddings and private events on the rooftop, which will look out across the scenic Cape Fear River.\r\n\r\nPoteat Hospitality is developing the new Aloft and will manage the hotel once it is open. Construction is expected to begin in downtown Wilmington within the next 30 days, and Clancy & Theys anticipates the project will take about 18 months to complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Aloft Hotel is only one of Clancy & Theys’ high‐profile projects in Wilmington, including several construction projects in the downtown and mid‐town markets. Most recently, Clancy & Theys was selected as the construction manager for North Waterfront Park, a multi‐use public space along Wilmington’s historic riverfront.

440	0064400000qROcAAAW	London School of Economics	None	London	ENG	None	Mace Ltd	The London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) has appointed Mace as Design and Build contractor to deliver its new state-of-the-art Centre Buildings Redevelopment (CBR).   The £123m project, which is set to be completed by November 2018, will be LSE?s largest ever redevelopment and will provide a world class teaching and learning environment for students and staff.  The redevelopment is in the heart of the School?s Aldwych campus and involves the construction of connected thirteen storey and six storey towers, incorporating lecture theatres, study areas, academic staff offices, a café/learning commons and a series of landscaped roof terraces.    A central feature of the redevelopment, designed by renowned architects Roger Stirk Harbour + Partners, is the creation of a new central plaza, enhancing public as well as academic space.    A focus on sustainability will be a key element of the design with an aspiration to achieving an outstanding BREEAM rating. Levels 2-13 of the new buildings will rely on natural ventilation and cooling through a complex external façade, solar shading and the use of exposed pre-cast soffits. In addition, the new towers will include bi-fuel CHP, photovoltaics, rainwater harvesting and a useable roof top green space.   The redevelopment will require demolition of four existing buildings, a process which started in June 2015. Following the demolition, construction is expected to start in July 2016.   Julian Robinson, Director of LSE Estates, said: ?The construction of the CBR is the tallest, largest and most expensive project for LSE, which will dramatically enhance the learning environment for our staff and students. Undertaking a complex project of this size and scale requires a significant degree of technical expertise which is why we are pleased to have appointed Mace to deliver this exciting new development.?     Business Unit Director for Public Sector at Mace, Terry Spraggett said: ?We are delighted to be working with LSE to deliver not only their biggest ever development but also a project which will positively shape the learning environment for students for years to come.?    http://www.macegroup.com/media-centre/mace-appointed-to-deliver-lse-s-centre-buildings-redevelopment-project-0	None	None	2018-08-27 06:37:01+00	2019-12-26 14:08:12+00	None	None	None	0	Broke Ground	None	None	2018-05-31	None	Mace Ltd	155 Moorgate London ENG EC2M 6XB UK	+44 (0)20 3824 3641	None	https://www.linkedin.com/company/mace-group/	None	https://twitter.com/MaceGroup	This is in the carpenters package \r\n\r\nTerry Spraggett	November 05 2019	None	None	None	None	None	None	www.macegroup.com	December 26 2019	None	England	London-School-of-Economics

536	0064400000jg8nhAAA	INDUSTRIAL BUSINESS PARK IN NORTON	None	NORTON	MA	None	CONDYNE LLC ADVANTAGE CONSTRUCTION	houghtons-land-proposal\r\n28 SEP CONDYNE CONSTRUCT INC. PROPOSES DEVELOPMENT OF INDUSTRIAL BUSINESS PARK IN NORTON, MA\r\nBraintree, MA (September 28, 2016) – Condyne Construct Inc. (Condyne), a vertically integrated real estate development firm that specializes in the New England market, has announced its proposal to develop a new industrial business park on the Houghton land in Norton, Massachusetts. The proposed park will consist of office and warehouse buildings and is estimated to be completed within 3 years of the start date inclusive of permitting and infrastructure improvements. The proposed industrial business park will be located adjacent to Route 495 which will minimize the traffic impacts to the area, while the project is expected to result in numerous economic benefits to the Town of Norton and its residents.\r\n\r\nThe proposed development will include 841,000 square-feet (s.f.) of various types of industrial buildings on a site spanning approximately 190 acres. A site of this scale was reviewed for a number of possible uses, including the potential for a retail development, a 400+ unit 40B residential apartment project or other residential options, but the highest and best use for the property was envisioned to be an industrial park. The proposed business park will have a minimal impact to the Town’s essential services including police, fire, and water and sewer and will be less intrusive to the surrounding community than a residential or retail development. The park will also provide a potential increase of $650,000 to $850,000 in annual taxes paid to the Town of Norton. To lessen any potential impacts to its abutters, Condyne is proposing a minimum buffer of 100 feet from its residential neighbors and plans to provide berms and trees for visual, sound and landscaping benefits. Additional tax benefits could include a projected $130,000 or more in annual excise tax revenue that is directed to the Town of Norton where tenant’s vehicles are garaged. The new facilities are expected to create a minimum of 150 to 200 new permanent jobs and provide opportunities for construction jobs that will benefit workers in the Norton and greater 495 South area.\r\n\r\nCondyne previously oversaw the development of the Norton Commerce Center, a thriving industrial and business park located in Norton. Utilizing this experience, they hope to create another successful project with a tenant mix which becomes integrated into the local community. Tenants in the Norton Commerce Center have exhibited generous Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) practices since their move into the industrial business park. These tenants have been known to support various town initiatives including fundraisers, youth sports, charities, and internships. It is expected that tenants within the proposed industrial business park to be developed on Houghton Farm land will continue the same CSR initiatives and make charitable contributions to the Norton community. Condyne intends to build paths for walking and running where the current driving range is located, and notes the remaining area could be used for the development of recreation fields in the future. In addition, portions of the land are slated to remain open so that the public is able to access the Canoe River, including a boat drop off and a small area for parking.\r\n\r\nThe proposed development also plans to provide a number of infrastructure improvements to the surrounding area including a new traffic signal to Route 123 allowing safe access for vehicles entering and exiting both sides of the main road. The traffic control will direct vehicle operators to use Leonard Street to Route 123 and Route 495. Truck traffic to or from the planned development will not be allowed to turn onto the streets in the abutting residential neighborhoods. Furthermore, Leonard Street will be widened and improved to accommodate vehicles of all kinds that are used in and serve the new business park.\r\n\r\nCondyne’s proposal also includes the installation of new or upgraded street pipes for water and sewer connections that will result in an improved flow to the area. The industrial business park will be a minor sewer user that can benefit from the excess volume the Town of Norton has access to with the assistance of Tri-Town Waste facility located near the Norton Commerce Center. There will be well access for water supported with the potential of rainwater leaders to provide additional irrigation for the landscape systems. The bushes and shrubs installed at the exterior of the facilities will be of a variety which require low water. In addition to the water conservation efforts in the new industrial business park, Condyne will make an effort to limit and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide for sustainable development practices including features such as low flow flush restrooms as well as energy efficient HVAC equipment and refrigerators.\r\n\r\nIn closing, Condyne’s proposal to develop a new industrial business park on the Houghton Farm land will create invaluable benefits for the Town of Norton. The new development with its signage, building designs, and architectural features will make it a premier industrial park in Southeastern Massachusetts. A warrant article, requiring a 2/3rd’s Vote, to change a portion of the local zoning from residential to industrial is scheduled for the Fall Town Meeting.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.condyne.com/2016/09/28/condyne-construct-inc-proposes-development-of-industrial-business-park-on-houghtons-land-in-norton-ma/	https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B5m56nC_a6IjRVkzVElYM0dNeHM	None	2017-02-08 16:54:49+00	2019-12-26 14:08:12+00	None	None	None	841000	Broke Ground	None	None	2017-02-17	None	CONDYNE LLC ADVANTAGE CONSTRUCTION	2 ADAMS PL QUINCY MA	(781) 848-8787	None	https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/321466/	None	None	Building 5 sub-contracts are complete and open to discuss Building #4 which will begin in February \r\n\r\nDonald O'Neill | cc: Jeffrey O'Neill	November 12 2019	None	None	None	None	None	None	http://condyne.com/	December 26 2019	None	Massachusetts	INDUSTRIAL-BUSINESS-PARK-IN-NORTON

The $144 million improvements will take place in three phases, all of which are being self-funded by the Baltimore Ravens, with a $24 million contribution from the Maryland Stadium Authority (MSA).\r\n\r\n“Gilbane is excited to be in a partnership with the Baltimore Ravens, HDC, Inc., Populous and MSA. We are committed to providing the best fan experience in the NFL through this project,” said Corey Sarver, Gilbane’s project executive. Phase one will change the way fans watch the game. Gilbane will install two new 4K ultra-high definition video displays nearly as large as the wingspan of a 747; spanning 200 feet by 36 feet each. Fans will not only have 28,000 square feet of new screens to experience the action, but also new angles to view their team’s biggest plays. The increased investment for the in-stadium video production will bring eleven manned cameras and additional robotic cameras to the stadium. They will provide more views of the field than ever before!

Fuller Elementary School. The closing of the $4.1 million sale of the 10.6 acre property is the final step in executing the real estate transaction where ownership of the property is officially transferred to FMUV.\r\n\r\nThe Fuller site is an important gateway to the City of Gloucester. The FMUV mixed-use project will transform this underutilized surplus property into a new economic engine, an enhanced center for community and recreation, and provide a housing option that will help solve the shortage described in the City’s Housing Production Plan.\r\n\r\nThe FMUV team, a partnership between Windover Construction, Sam Park & Co., the Dolben Co., and the YMCA of the North Shore, will redevelop the parcel on Route 128 adjacent to Gloucester Crossing. The $70 million private investment includes 200 new housing units (including thirty units of affordable housing), over 25,000 square feet of new retail space, and a new $23 million first-class YMCA that will provide enhanced health, education and social services for thousands of residents of Cape Ann.

The buildings have not even begun to be built.  We are only in the beginning construction phase, and the project turnover dates aren’t until 2022, so there are no interior finishes for you to tour on site to aid in pricing.  Brian had given Jessica some sheets from our drawing set to assist in pricing.  If you are capable of turning a number around in the next 2 weeks, he can forward those along to you.

The school, set to open in fall of 2020, is designed to accommodate 1,180 students ranging from fifth to eighth grade.\r\n\r\nIn partnership with the town of Braintree, Massachusetts School Building Authority, Hill International, and architect Miller Dyer Spears, the Shawmut team has developed a detailed plan for the approximately 108,000-square-feet renovation and 77,000-square-feet of new construction. The project includes a prominent new entry, three-story classroom block, new gym, and a new Media Commons infill at the existing courtyard. The plan reuses the existing school, while improving the overall layout and addressing existing building concerns. The expansion and site enhancements will minimize impact on the existing playfields and maximize available parking capacity in the best location. Additional amenities will include separate Academy Commons for grades 5-6 and 7-8 to provide more intimate environments for focused group activities. Classrooms will offer flexible environments, supportive of a variety of teaching methods and student collaboration.\r\n\r\n\r\nJoin us as we break ground on Braintree’s new #ShawmutBuilt East Middle School in Massachusetts—a 185,000-square-foot facility designed to accommodate 1,180 students.

742	0062R00000tel2qQAA	Meeker High School	550 school street	Meeker	CO	None	Haselden Construction, LLC	MEEKER | The high school construction project got its legal stamp of approval Monday night when Meeker School District’s board unanimously approved a contract with Haselden Construction for $32.24 million and $90,000 in pre-construction fees. The contract was extensively reviewed before making its way to the board.\r\nSaul Abraham of NV5, the District’s owner’s representative, stated at the Feb. 11 meeting that Haselden’s original bid had come in higher than expected, but a recent collaborative planning session had knocked off about three quarters of that 15 percent overage, according to Superintendent Chris Selle. “Without talking specific numbers we’re on the right track,” he said. Selle also mentioned the District received a $564,000 Homeland Security grant toward the project, submitted a BEST grant for $7.5 million, and are working on a DOLA grant as well.\r\n\r\nHaselden Construction recently broke ground on construction of Meeker High School in Meeker, Colo. The 87,600 SF addition and remodel, designed by architect TreanorHL, will provide better facilities for the school’s faculty and almost 200 students. Construction will touch nearly every aspect of the school, including a new classroom wing and gymnasium; remodel to the existing gymnasium and auditorium; and updates to the commons area, administration offices, kitchen, science labs, metals classroom, and woodshop.

BERNARD, OHIO\r\nIn an effort to help the St. Bernard-Elmwood Place City School District plan towards successful bond issue campaign that would result in securing funding for a new consolidated District school, our team assisted in developing the campaign strategy. Analyzing the master plan, we reviewed existing building conditions, plus validation and refinement of OFCC data. A preliminary program of requirements (POR) was prepared and preliminary design concepts were developed.  Our team also supported the District by providing graphic material support and social media management for the public campaign. With the help of marketing collateral given to the community to explain the project needs and costs associated, the bond levy passed in November of 2016. Our team was awarded the full A/E contract in early 2017, and the project is currently underway. The new Pk-12 Campus will provide the District with a consolidated state-of-the-art school.\r\n\r\nWhile an architect has not yet been selected for the roject, the layout for space, cost and location are already in full swing. The 144,000-square-foot school would be built on the existing 6.6-acre site that is currently shared by St. Bernard-Elmwood Place High School and St. Bernard Elementary School, which are located at 4615 Tower Ave. and 4515 Tower Ave., respectively. Those locations will be demolished upon completion of the project.	None	None	2019-07-12 04:19:46+00	2019-11-04 15:17:51+00	None	None	None	144000	Broke Ground	None	2020-12-07	2019-07-12	None	D.A.G.

Note there is minimal site work.  Plumbing work shown on Reference Drawings.\r\n2019 SD Arch (Partially Completed)\r\n2019 SD Structural (Partially Completed)\r\n2019 SD HVAC (Partially Completed)\r\n2019 SD Elect (Narrative, Markups and Riser)\r\nFULL 2019 SCOPE OF WORK NARRATIVE by FLOOR! (Developed by Architect, Engineers and Cork-Howard)\r\nLowest Qualified Bidder will be selected for submission for the SD Bid and carried forth through the Design Development and Construction Document phases for verification and on for the contract in their discipline for the construction of the project.  This schedule has been firmly set by the Owner and will require Standard Work Days and Hours as well as After Hours and Days for some scopes to complete the work.  Please include what is needed to complete your scope in this time frame for the project.\r\n\r\nUse the file “SD Sept 2019 Bid Docs” for work scope which is on the Basement Level, new walls at Mechanical 003.   There are three walls of it best shown on Sheet G2.00, Floor Plan #1.  This the extent of the new work with 8” CMU.   \r\n\r\nThen at the Level 1 Plan, sheet AD1.01, you will see a new door Circle 05 where the door will be removed and the opening filled in,  It is an exist brick veneer wall so you will only have brick to work with.  Th opening will need to be filled hopefully using removed brick. \r\n\r\nYou can include the cutting of the existing masonry here and elsewhere below if you want, though keep it separate.  If we cut, we will coordinate with you prior to cutting.  \r\n\r\nAnd to the left and down at the inside corner you see Circle 24.  That is a fill in at an existing 3070 door.  What is not shown but needs to be in your scope is that door Circle 24 is being relocated just above it in the same wall, basically next to the fill in, 12” or so from the existing top edge from where it is now.  This opening will need to be finished with CMU on the interior and with brick on the exterior.  Again, hopefully using brick from the new opening. \r\n\r\nDiagonally from that Circle 24 going up and left there is another Circle 24 where another opening is cut into an existing CMU wall.  There you will be finishing the opening we will cut.\r\n\r\nAgain, diagonally left from that new door opening is another Circle 24 indicating a long CMU wall that will be cut at the exterior wall corner and removed.  Your scope at this point is to finish the corner of the exterior wall CMU.\r\n\r\nThe remaining of the Masonry scope is the repointing of the existing brick on the Front and the two sides of the front building (that you see from the street).  Then there is cleaning of all of the brick, all four sides of the facility by pressure washing or SoftSpray.  Pay particular attention to under winds with AC units that have stained the brick. \r\n\r\nWhen reviewing the Demo sheets, use the corresponding proposed floor plans, A1.00 for the basement and A1.01 for first floor.  All work is to be executed approximately May 15th to July 15th.  Our schedule includes a day and a night shift though your work would probably be all day work.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have questions.  The facility is in use at this time of the and all exterior doors locked.  If you go by and see someone inside, let them know you are pricing the remodeling.  But you will be able to walk around the building and get a better idea of the scope outside.

Tulane is the largest employer in the city of New Orleans. After Hurricane Katrina, the university shifted its focus to community rebuilding and re-envisioning. The architecture school plays a crucial role in this effort, and updating the century-old structure was to support this vision. The design added an addition on the back side of the Richardson, two wings that hold faculty offices, a design/build shop, and public gathering spaces. The design team employed a number of sustainable strategies, including rooftop PV panels, solar thermal panels, and a rooftop cistern for rainwater storage. A canopy of thin-film PV panels shades a planted roof that’s irrigated by the harvested rainwater. A number of site enhancements, including a ground level cafe, draw people into the building, opening up the school to architects and non-architects alike.\r\n\r\nhttps://architizer.com/projects/tulane-richardson-memorial-hall/	None	None	2019-07-19 05:28:00+00	2019-12-26 14:08:12+00	None	None	None	100000	Broke Ground	Education	None	2019-07-19	None	Donahuefavret Contractors, Inc.	3030 East Causeway Approach Mandeville LA 70448-3562 United States	+1.985.626.4431	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MyWmWmlDzb9xWutyH--FJUa8YdV1Jbeb/preview	https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/4489870/?pathWildcard=4489870	https://www.facebook.com/DonahueFavret	None	Stacey Deubler is no longer working with DonahueFavret Contactors.

Outdoor community spaces will include three courtyards with seating and raised garden planters.\r\n\r\nSinanian is proud to announce that it was selected as the general contractor for the proposed development known as the Garden Brook Senior Village Apartments, located in Garden Grove, CA. This unique project involves the adaptive reuse of a half-built structure dubbed the “Rusty Skeleton” by locals. The project, originally slated as a mixed-use retail and luxury condominium development, had been abandoned for over a decade, a magnet for decay and crime in the city. This new adaptive reuse project introduces 395 below-market senior apartments, along with 13,000 SF of restaurant and retail space and over   of community and recreational area. The mission is to transform an unsightly steel frame, visible from the Garden Grove Freeway, into a fresh new gateway for the city. Sinanian will break ground on this project in the coming months. This project was awarded a 2018 Gold Nugget Merit Award Winner for Best Senior Community of the Boards.

813	0062R00000tfAU9QAM	Middle Georgia State University	None	Macon	GA	None	Garbutt Construction	Planning and pre-construction services are underway for two Middle Georgia State University buildings. The renovation of Dillard Hall and Roberts Library, two vital facilities of Middle Georgia State’s Cochran campus, is led by Garbutt Construction Company as construction manager.\r\nThe overall intent of the project is to optimize the use of the space by organizing functions between and within the two facilities, uniting the two buildings according to like-purposes. The renovation of Dillard Hall is focused primarily on the first floor of the original section of the 1958 building. This area is designated to be the new home for the expanding Nursing and Occupational Therapy Assistant Programs.\r\nRoberts Library will undergo selective renovations and re-purposing on each of its three stories. Code compliance upgrades are anticipated to be a major component of the work scope for Roberts Hall, including an elevator for the building. Space re-allocations throughout the building will result in enhanced and expanded space for study, collaboration, and lounge area.\r\nAdam McEachern is the project manager dedicated to this mid-century modernization project. Lean Construction methodologies are anticipated to be a driving force in the timely completion of Dillard Hall and Roberts Library.

The demolition of two existing buildings allows for two new four-story buildings with 625 beds in 194,000 GSF. Located in the heart of the LMU campus next to the Doheny Hall and William Hannon Library, one of the buildings provides 326 beds of freshman housing, which includes 296 beds of double bedrooms, 20 beds of single bedrooms and 10 for resident assistants for a total of about 90,000 GSF. The other building provides upper-division housing, which includes 76 beds of double bedrooms, 36 beds of single bedrooms, four for RAs and 180 beds in five-bedroom units (two double and one single). Construction for both buildings consists of four-story, Type V wood construction over conventional foundation. One of the challenges of this project is to have stand-alone water, power, and gas without connecting to the Central Utility Plant. The project intends to meet LEED Silver or better.

Wilson is currently serving as the Construction Manager at Risk for COCA’s facility expansion project. Set to open in early 2020, the multi-phased project will nearly double the size of the current facility. Phase 1 of the project was completed by S. M. Wilson in June 2018 and consisted of renovations to the Kuehner West Wing Facilities. Phase 2 is currently underway with the construction of the two-level Ferring East Wing addition, but not without its challenges.\r\nhttp://smwilson.com/tag/coca\r\nCOCA\r\n2018 Facility Expansion\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 2016, S. M. Wilson was once again chosen to provide construction services on COCA’s second expansion. The $28 million renovation and construction project includes the addition of an east wing to COCA’s exisiting facility. The new wing, which will double COCA’s size, will feature a 450-seat theater, more than 8,000 square feet of new studio space, performance lab, community commons area, classroom space and a designated area for families to drop off and pick up students.\r\n\r\nThis will be a two phase project. Phase 1 will consist of renovating the existing Founders Theater into a sky-lit performance lab and two new dance studios and upgrading two other spaces into an art and design space – called the Gold Studio and the Dierbergs Teaching Kitchen.\r\n\r\nPhase 2 will be the demolition of the 2005 addition to make way for the new 47,000 SF, three-level addition. It will include a 450-seat theater, three new dance studios, community and administrative space.\r\nhttp://smwilson.com/projects/coca	None	None	2018-11-23 08:32:34+00	2019-12-06 11:42:39+00	None	None	None	47000	Broke Ground	None	2019-10-23	2018-11-23	None	S.

The college has informed the town and is working with Turner Construction and outside design professionals to evaluate our options,” Dartmouth spokeswoman Diana Lawrence said via email. “There are no safety issues related to the matter.”\r\n\r\nThe project on the so-called “west end” of campus is to include a new building housing the Thayer School of Engineering as well as computer sciences for Dartmouth. It also is to include the Magnuson Center for Entrepreneurship and Dartmouth’s electron microscope facility.\r\n\r\nWork began on the 160,000-square-foot building this winter, and Turner Construction Co., a national firm based in New York City, discovered the mistake as it prepared to install a tower crane at the worksite, Dartmouth said on its website.

Despite a prominent Madison Street and Wacker Drive location, the building no longer retains its market prominence with nearly 20 percent vacancy and minimal street-level presence. LJC proposes transforming the building by reorienting the entry from a small portal on Wacker to a three-story, lineal lobby along Madison that creates a dialog with its northern neighbor across the street. A two-story, free-form copper screen flows from the façade through the lobby, which works both to draw pedestrians into the building and its amenities and to augment the property’s corner presence, re-establishing its stature in the city. The addition of a street-facing café and third-floor restaurant terrace form a collection of spaces that further blur the line between interior and exterior environments and invite passersby to experience a renewed One South Wacker.\r\n\r\nLocation\r\nChicago, Illinois\r\n\r\nSize\r\n1,163,990 SF\r\n\r\nType\r\nCorporate + Commercial, Featured	None	https://theljc.com/portfolio/one-south-wacker/	2019-07-23 07:00:11+00	2019-12-26 14:08:12+00	None	None	None	1163990	Broke Ground	None	2019-08-05	2019-07-23	None	Bear Construction	1501 Rohlwing Road Rolling Meadows IL 60008	(847) 222-1900	http://www.bearcc.com/Subcontractors.php	https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/1565523/?pathWildcard=1565523	https://www.facebook.com/Bearcc1	None	Please send all proposals for the 28th Floor Amenities Project at One South Wacker to Terry Kuzel.\r\n\r\nAdam Hill |	July 22 2019	Sealand was already let out for this job.

The two-building redevelopment, known as Bridge Point Wood Dale, is located in Wood Dale, IL.\r\n\r\nThe first phase of the redevelopment of 700 North Wood Dale Road in the northwest Chicago suburb began in May with the demolition of four preexisting masonry buildings on the 21.5-acre site. The groundbreaking ceremony marked the beginning of construction on the two new structures. PREMIER is managing design + build services for both new warehouse buildings.\r\n\r\nThe 100,738-square foot warehouse for Forward Space will utilize precast wall panels with form-liner accents and will feature curtain wall and clerestory glass elements. The 32’ clear height building will have two drive-in doors and 12 dock positions. Forward Space is a woman-owned, Steelcase authorized commercial furniture dealership that provides office furniture, workplace planning, procurement and delivery/installation across Chicagoland and Milwaukee.\r\n\r\nEach Bridge Point Wood Dale building will have a 60’ concrete dock apron with heavy duty asphalt pavement for truck maneuvering. Forward Space’s building will offer parking for 183 vehicles and is slated for completion in spring 2020. The second building, a 241,888-square foot speculative warehouse, also has a target delivery date of Spring of 2020.
